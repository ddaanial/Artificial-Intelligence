These are some of my projects in Artificial Intelligence:

Adversarial Search

  
  [Connect four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four) is a two-player connection board game, in which each player chooses a color and in turn drops the token of that color    into a seven-column six-row grid.
  Eech token when dropped occupies the lowest available empty cell. we are going to implement the connect four game.
  We are supposed to play with a rational agent (RA) that chooses its moves based on an adverserial search. 
  

Genetic Algorithm

  In this problem, we will tackle the knapspack problem with a genetic algorithm. You can find more detail about this problem [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/0-1-knapsack-problem-dp-10/).
