These are some of my projects in Artificial Intelligence:

Adversarial Search

  [Connect four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four)
  Connect four is a two-player connection board game, in which each player chooses a color and in turn drops the token of that color into a seven-column six-row grid.
  Eech token when dropped occupies the lowest available empty cell. we are going to implement the connect four game.
  We are supposed to play with a rational agent (RA) that chooses its moves based on an adverserial search.
